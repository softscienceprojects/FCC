Free Code Camp projects - store my solutions for later revising

As I've been going along in the lessons I've been storing these onto files on my computer, or a codepen. 

I've decided to try to start consolidating everything on my github, to keep track of my practice and make it a bit easier to reference.

A large part of learning for me is revising, so this makes everything into a nice little reference index to remember how I solved a particular problem.
